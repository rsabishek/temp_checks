Usha is a very good comunicator and makes constant effort in making sure the problem statements are clear and solid. 
In her first stint with UI design on the onegs-idp-ui repo, she was able to clearly get the requirements and made solid effort in getting the designs developed with perfection.
She is super approachable to her colleagues, makes constant effort to keep the team bonding going (helps in organising birthdays / farewells / team outings).
Wish her good luck.
