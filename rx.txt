My interactions with Hong were mostly during his brief stint in Bangalore. He 
was super approachable, super friendly, and super technical. I was able to get more info on the SecurID works which were done earlier in Ping Infra and he took a great effort in making sure I get unblocked and gave my right POCs to proceed further.
