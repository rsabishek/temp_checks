1. Replace `C:\path\to\your\go\source\main.go` with the path to your main Go source file.
2. Replace `C:\path\to\output\directory\yourApp.exe` with where you want the executable to be generated.
3. Replace `C:\path\to\destination\yourApp.exe` with where you want to copy the executable to.

Save the script as a `.bat` or `.cmd` file and execute it. The script will build your Go application, producing an `.exe` file, and then copy that file to the specified destination.

Remember to ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the output and
