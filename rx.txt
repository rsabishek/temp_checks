OAuth Client Management - Custom Terraform Provider

The OAuth Client Management provider is used to interact with the OAuth Client ID related resources supported by the OAuth Client Management API. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Example Usage:
# Configure the PingFederate provider
provider "oauth-client-management" {
  base_url   = "https://"
  username   = "admin"
  password   = "yourpassword"
}

# Define an OAuth client resource
resource "pingfederate_oauth_client" "example_client" {
  # Unique identifier for the resource instance
  client_id         = "my-client"
  
  # Display name for the OAuth client
  display_name      = "My OAuth Client"
  
  # Redirect URIs for authorization callbacks
  redirect_uris     = ["https://app.example.com/callback"]
  
  # Grant types allowed for the client
  allowed_grant_types = ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]
  
  # Scopes the client is authorized to request
  allowed_scopes     = ["openid", "profile", "email"]
  
  # Whether client is enabled or not
  enabled            = true
}
