Kritika is a quick learner and very good in articulating the technical details. She was able to quickly understand the Admin UI services & the entire admin dashboard react app and took care of its regular production deployments. 
She shows great enthusiasm and makes constant effort to keep the team bonding going (helps in organising birthdays / farewells / team outings).
Wish her all the best on her career and to new heights.
