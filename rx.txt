Absolutely. Here's how you might define a Terraform configuration that uses the `oauth_client` resource based on the schema provided:

```hcl
resource "your_provider_name_oauth_client" "example_client" {
  name        = "test-client-xyz"
  description = "test-client-create"
  redirect_uris = [
    "https://localhost:8080",
    "https://localhost:8081"
  ]
  risk_profile = 1

  client_auth = {
    type   = "SECRET"
    secret = "94e8b2a3cdff4ea8b8fb7d51ed380eea794e8b2a3cdff4ea8b8fb7d51ed380ea1"
  }

  application_type = "web"

  oidc = {
    realm = "INSTITUTIONAL"
    mfa = {
      mfa_required = true
      # if mfaProviders and other attributes are needed, they should be added here following a similar pattern.
    }
  }

  # ... other fields if any, based on the schema ...
}
```

This HCL configuration defines a resource of type `oauth_client` (assuming the provider's name is `your_provider_name`). The attributes used here are based on the schema attributes you provided.

Remember to replace `"your_provider_name"` with the actual name of your provider.

To apply this configuration, you'd use the typical Terraform commands:

1. `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
2. `terraform plan` to see the execution plan.
3. `terraform apply` to apply the changes and create the OAuth client.

Make sure the provider is properly configured to communicate with your backend/API before applying this configuration.
